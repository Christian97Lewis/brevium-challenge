3 hour coding challenge for Brevium

## Christian Note
I focused on getting all API integrations working first in the ServerProxy.java file. 
I got most things working, but didn't work out all the logic for scheduling valid appointments. 
I was somewhat confused on if it was a requirement to schedule appointments within the preferredDays
and preferredDocs or if that was just a preference. If I had more time, I could work out the logic 
better for scheduling these appointments.
